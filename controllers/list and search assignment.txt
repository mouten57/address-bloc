For the following situations, determine which search approach to use and why would you take that approach. Write your answers in the submission box below.

__Performing a search of a sorted by name IRS database for a taxpayer name.__

 * I would use a binary search. It is sorted so binary search would be very fast and effective.


__Searching through an unsorted list containing the days of the weekend__

 * It's small and unsorted, so I would use an iterative search.

__Given a list of the planets in the Milky Way in ascending order by size, search for a planet with a given size.__

* Again, it's sorted, so I would use a binary search.


__Searching for a checkpoint name in an unsorted list of Bloc checkpoints__

* Unsorted, so I would use an iterative search. Or I would sort them first and then use a binary search.
